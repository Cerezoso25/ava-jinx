# Ava-Jinx
This is an script I made to quickly install ava-ryujinx on linux, It's just for personal use since pine-jinx exists already. But feel free to use it if you want.

Usage:
Open a terminal, paste <br>
`bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cerezoso25/ava-jinx/main/ava-jinx.sh)"` <br>
